For more information on our research, or if you are interested in collaboration, please get in touch by [e-mail](mailto:a.walsh[at]imperial.ac.uk).
We are located at the [Department of Materials, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/departments/materials/), which is in the Royal School of Mines on Exhibition Road.
Also visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/WMD-group) and [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/aronwalsh).

In addition to hosting visiting scientists, we are always keen to support early-career researchers, and there are a number of funding options (most require applications 6 -- 12 months in advance). 
An extensive list can be found [here](https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/).
Note that our group focuses solely on theory and simulation of materials.
