We are exploring the control of function and properties of materials away from equilibrium using a combination of external stimuli. 
Applications include solid-state sensors and switches.
We have a close connection with time-resolved crystallography through the EPSRC [Applying Long-lived Metastable States with Switchable Functionality](http://www.metastable-materials.org.uk) programme. 

## Optical
including single-crystal phase transitions due to linkage isomerism.

## Thermal
involving displacive instabilities, including highly anharmonic systems where there exists large differences between local and average structures.

## Electric
including both conventional ferroelectrics, with macroscopic polarisation, to systems that exhibit microscopic polarisation domains that can respond to an applied electric field. 

## Kinetic
covering crystal engineering into new polymorphs, as well as the fabrication of 
artificial heterostructures and material composites.
