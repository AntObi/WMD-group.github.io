To strengthen our application areas, we also develop techniques and software tools in computational chemistry and physics. 

##Lattice dynamics
working closely with Atsushi Togo (Kyoto University) on the development and testing of [Phonopy](http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/). Our current focus is vibrational spectroscopy and anharmonic interactions (lifetime effects).

##Thermodynamics
in addition to electronic properties, first-principles techniques also provide accurate total energies, which can be used to construct phase diagrams and reaction fields. 

##Imperfect crystals 
all crystals are defective owing to configurational entropy. Materials modelling can probe both the probability of defect formation as well as their structural, vibrational and optical properties.
