To support our three application areas, we also develop techniques and software tools in computational chemistry and physics. 

## Lattice dynamics
working closely with [Atsushi Togo](http://atztogo.github.io/) (Kyoto University) on the development and testing of [Phonopy](http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/). Our current focus is theoretical vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions (lifetime effects).

## Thermodynamics
in addition to electronic properties, first-principles techniques also provide accurate total energies, which can be used to construct phase diagrams and reaction fields 
as a function of temperature and pressure. 
These can be used to identify processing windows for entirely new phases and properties. 

## Imperfect crystals 
all crystals are defective owing to configurational entropy. Materials modelling can probe both the probability of defect formation as well as their structural, vibrational and optical properties.
This includes the effect of structural defects on electron-hole recombination in photovoltaic devices.
