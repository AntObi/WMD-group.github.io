In support of each of our application areas, we develop techniques and software tools in computational chemistry and physics. 

## Lattice dynamics and temperature 
working closely with [Atsushi Togo](http://atztogo.github.io/) (Kyoto University) on the development and testing of [Phonopy](http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/) and [Phono3py](http://atztogo.github.io/phono3py/). Our current focus is theoretical vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions (lifetime effects), and thermal conductivity. See an application to soft modes in the record thermoelectric material [SnSe](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.075502), which resulted in the [Modemap](https://github.com/JMSkelton/ModeMap) package.

## High-throughput screening and machine learning
we are developing a low-cost screening package based on exploring new materials using simple chemical descriptors. Our implementation is in the open-source Python package [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT).
See our recent perspective in [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0337-2) on the potential for machine learning tools in the chemical sciences.

## Thermodynamics and synthesizability 
in addition to electronic properties, first-principles simulation techniques also provide accurate total energies, which can be used to construct phase diagrams and reaction fields 
as a function of temperature and pressure. 
These can be used to identify processing windows for entirely new phases and properties. 
One application has been [Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>](https://github.com/WMD-group/CZTS-model), which included the Monte Carlo package [Eris](https://github.com/WMD-group/Eris).

## Imperfect crystals and disorder
all crystals are defective owing to configurational entropy. Materials modelling can probe both the probability of defect formation as well as their structural, vibrational and optical properties.
This includes the effect of disorder and defects on electron-hole recombination in photovoltaic devices, 
and approaches to achieve "defect tolerence".
We are involved in the application the multi-scale [ChemShell](http://www.chemshell.org) package for embedded crystals, inspired by the [Mott-Littleton](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1989/f2/f29898500341) procedure for the calculation of point defects in crystals. A recent focus has been on carrier capture and recombination, which produced the package [CarrierCapture.jl](https://github.com/WMD-group/CarrierCapture.jl).
