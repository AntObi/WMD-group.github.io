Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials formed of organic and inorganic building blocks. 
The chemical space for synthesising these systems is large. There is immense potential for engineering novel
functionality.

## Electroactive hybrid solids 
We are developing principles to control the optical properties, magnetism, and electrical conductivity of hybrid materials. 
These include ion exchange, ligand modification, and defect engineering.
Our research combines electronic structure theory with universal forcefields to build multi-scale models with the ability to accurately describe physical processes in nanoporous solids. 

In addition to being involved in the first reports of metallic and semiconducting MOFs, a major development is a procedure to calculate the ionisation potentials, workfunctions, and band alignments of porous organic-inorganic frameworks. The procedure was first published in [JACS](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja4110073) and is implemented in the tool [MacroDensity](https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity).
