We are exploring the control of function and properties of materials away from equilibrium using a combination of external stimuli. 
Applications include solid-state sensors and switches.
We have a close connection with time-resolved crystallography through the EPSRC [Applying Long-lived Metastable States with Switchable Functionality](http://www.metastable-materials.org.uk) project.
Our research into metastable materials is also supported by the [Philip Leverhulme Prize in Chemistry](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/grant-schemes/philip-leverhulme-prizes). 

## Optical stimuli
including single-crystal phase transitions due to linkage isomerism.

## Thermal stimuli
involving displacive instabilities, including highly anharmonic systems where there exists large differences between local and average structures.

## Electrical stimuli
including both conventional ferroelectrics, with macroscopic polarisation, to systems that exhibit microscopic polarisation domains that respond to an applied electric field. 

## Kinetic control
covering crystal engineering into new polymorphs, as well as the fabrication of 
artificial heterostructures and material composites.
