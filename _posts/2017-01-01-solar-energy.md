The direct conversion of sunlight to electricity in solar cells is one sustainable solution to future global energy demand.

New materials are required that satisfy the chemical and physical requirements to support a terrawatt photovoltaic industry. For example, building-integrated solar cells require materials that can be processed over large areas without sacrificing cost, performance, or the environment.

As members of the [Starcell](http://www.starcell.eu), [UK Energy Materials](http://www.energy-materials.org.uk) and [SuperSolar](https://twitter.com/SuperSolarHub) projects, we are involved in the development of a range of novel materials for thin-film solar cells:

## Metal oxide solar cells 
including Cu<sub>2</sub>O and BiFeO<sub>3</sub>.

## Metal sulfide solar cells
including SnS, FeS<sub>2</sub>, CuSbS<sub>2</sub>, CuBiS<sub>2</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>.

## Multi-component semiconductors
including Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, and 
photoferroics such as SbSI and BiSeBr.

## Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites 
including CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and [HC(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]PbI<sub>3</sub>
(see our [perovskite publications](/assets/wmd_perovskites.txt) and [Mendeley group](https://www.mendeley.com/community/425e1ce0-9d62-3498-a2f1-aa5c5a07c27e/)).
