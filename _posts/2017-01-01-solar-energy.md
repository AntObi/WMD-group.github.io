The direct conversion of sunlight to electricity in solar cells is one sustainable solution to future global energy demand.

New materials are required that satisfy the chemical and physical requirements to support a terrawatt photovoltaic industry. For example, building-integrated solar cells require materials that can be processed over large areas without sacrificing cost, performance, or the environment. 


As members of the [Starcell](http://www.starcell.eu), [UK Energy Materials](http://www.energy-materials.org.uk) and [SuperSolar](https://twitter.com/SuperSolarHub) projects, we are involved in the development of a range of novel materials for thin-film solar cells. We have contributed to the development of the [Emerging inorganic solar cell efficiency tables](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ab2338) to track progress in the field. 

## Metal oxide solar cells 
including Cu<sub>2</sub>O and BiFeO<sub>3</sub>.

## Metal sulfide solar cells
including SnS, FeS<sub>2</sub>, CuSbS<sub>2</sub>, CuBiS<sub>2</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>.

## Multi-component semiconductors
