Metal-organic frameworks are crystalline materials formed of organic and inorganic building blocks. 
The chemical space for forming these frameworks is large with the potential for engineering novel
functionality.

## Electroactive hybrid solids 
We are developing principles to control optical properties, magnetism and electrical conductivity. 
In addition to electronic structure theory, we are also constructing universal forcefields and multi-scale methods to describe these complex frameworks.
