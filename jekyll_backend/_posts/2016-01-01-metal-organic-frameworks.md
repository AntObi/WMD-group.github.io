Metal-organic frameworks are crystalline materials formed of organic and inorganic building blocks. 
The chemical space for synthesising these frameworks is large with the potential for engineering novel
functionality.

## Electroactive hybrid solids 
We are developing principles to control optical properties, magnetism and electrical conductivity. 
Our research is combining electronic structure theory with universal forcefields to build multi-scale models with the ability to accurately describe these complex frameworks.
