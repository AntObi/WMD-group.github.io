Metal-organic frameworks are crystalline materials formed of organic and inorganic building blocks. 
The chemical space for forming these frameworks is large with the potential for engineering novel
functionality.

## Electroactive hybrid solids 
We are developing principles on how to control optical properties, magnetism and electrical conductivity.
