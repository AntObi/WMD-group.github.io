We are exploring the control of function and properties of materials away from equilibrium using a range of stimuli.

## Light
Linkage isomerism.

## Heat
Phase changes and displacive instabilities, where there are large differences between local and average structures.

## Electric Fields
Ferroelectrics...

## Crystal Engineering
Growth... directed crystallisation into new polymorphs.
