We are exploring the control of function and properties of materials away from equilibrium using a range of stimuli.

## Optical
Including single-crystal phase and property transitions due to linkage isomerism.

## Thermal
Modelling phase changes and displacive instabilities, including systems where there exists large differences between local and average structures.

## Electric
Including both conventional ferroelectrics, where the direct of macroscopic polarisation can be changes, to systems that exhibit microscopic polarisation domains that can also respond to an applied electric field. 

## Kinetic
Directed crystal engineering into new polymorphs and the fabrication of 
artificial heterostructures and material composites.
