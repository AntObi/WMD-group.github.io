The direct conversion of sunlight to electricity in solar cells is a sustainable solution to future global energy supply.

New materials are required to satisfy the chemical and physical requirements to support a terrawatt photovoltaic industry. For example, building-integrated solar cells require materials that can be processed over large areas without sacrificing performance.

We are involved in the development of materials for thin-film solar cells including:
