Key application areas involve energy conversion, storage and transport, including thermoelectric, electrocaloric, electrochromic and photovoltaic devices. 

Our interests in computational materials science cover the condensed-matter physics and solid-state chemistry of advanced materials, including the bulk and 
defect properties of metal oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and metal-organic frameworks.
