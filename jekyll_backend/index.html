The research group of Professor Aron Walsh, Royal Society University Research Fellow and Chair of Materials Theory in Chemistry at the University of Bath.

Key application areas involve energy conversion, storage and transport, including thermoelectric, electrocaloric, electrochromic and photovoltaic devices. 

Our interests in computational materials science cover the condensed-matter physics and solid-state chemistry of advanced materials, including the bulk and 
defect properties of metal oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and metal-organic frameworks.
