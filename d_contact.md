Also visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/WMD-group) and [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/aronwalsh).

Keith, Katrine, Dan, Lora, and Jonathan are located in the [Department of Chemistry, University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/chemistry/). Visit them in Building 1 South, Room 1.14.

In addition to hosting visiting scientists, we are always keen to support early-career researchers, and there are a number of funding options (most require applications 6 -- 12 months in advance).

* [Imperial PhD Scholarship](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/icphd/)

* [EPSRC fellowship](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/fellows/areas/)
* [1851 fellowship](http://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/?award=research)

We are active members of the [Thomas Young Centre for the Theory and Simulation of Materials](http://www.thomasyoungcentre.org) and the [UK Materials Design Network](http://mdn-uk.github.io).
