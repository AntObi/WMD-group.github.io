For more information on our work, or if you are interested in joining the group or collaborating, please get in touch by [e-mail](mailto:a.walsh@bath.ac.uk).
Our main research lab is located in Room 1.14, Building 1 South, [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/travel-advice/). 
Also visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/WMD-group), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/aron-walsh/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lonepair).

In addition to hosting visiting scientists in the fields of computational chemistry and physics, we are always keen to support emerging early-career researchers, and there are a number of excellent funding options available (however, they need to be applied for 6 - 12 months in advance).
