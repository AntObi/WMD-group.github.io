[Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) is Full Professor in Materials Design in the [Department of Materials](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/departments/materials) at Imperial College London (UK) and Dual Underwood Distinguished Professor in [Materials Science and Engineering](http://mse.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/) at Yonsei University (Korea).

Aron studied at Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), and later held positions at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA), University College London (UK), and the University of Bath (UK).

His interests in materials modelling cover the chemistry and physics of functional solids, including 
metal oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and metal-organic frameworks.
