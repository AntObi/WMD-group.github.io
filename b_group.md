The research group of Professor Aron Walsh, Royal Society University Research Fellow and Chair of Materials Theory in [Chemistry](http://www.bath.ac.uk/chemistry/) at the University of Bath. 
He also holds a dual faculty position in [Materials Science and Engineering](http://mse.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/) at Yonsei University, Korea.

Aron studied at Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), and later held positions at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA) and University College London (UK).

Our interests in materials modelling cover the condensed matter physics 
and solid state chemistry of advanced materials, including the bulk and 
defect properties of metal oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and metal-organic frameworks. 
Key application areas involve energy conversion, storage and transport.
